    <p><b>Expression Search / GMailUI - NG </b>is an extension to Thunderbird (versions 31.0+) which adds powerful
      message searching features.
      Init by Ken Mixter, developed over many years by Opera Wang, updated to TB 78+ by Klaus Buecher/opto.</p>
    <p>
      Type "hello world" to search within the current view for this string in subject/from/to/cc.<br />
      Type "from:fred to:tom attachment:yes" or "f:fred t:tom att:yes" to see all messages from Fred to Tom in the
      current view that have an attachment.<br />
      Type "s:bbb t:(oo -pp)" to see all messages with subject bbb, send to oo but not to pp.
      Press Ctrl+Enter to have this search apply to all folders through virtual folder.<br />
      Press Shift+Enter to invoke Gloda Search in all indexed folders.<br />
      Use Ctrl/Shift+Right Click to search the clicked subject/From/Recipient.<br />
    </p>

    <h3>Search expressions and quick search key</h3>
    <p>
      This extension adds a new search text box to the end of your quick search bar. Whatever phrase you enter
      is searched for in your currently selected folder's to/from/cc/subject fields. Notice that by default
      the body is not searched for your search phrase. If that results in too many matches,you can focus the search
      using "operators". Operators are just short words followed by a colon, such as "from:amazon.com".
    </p>

    Here are some examples:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><b>weekend plans</b></p>
        <p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for
          'weekend plans' in the <i>from</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>cc</i>, or <i>subject</i>
          fields.</p>
        <p>If "Act as normal filter" enabled, the "Sender", "Recipients", "Subject" and "Body" buttons will
          determine to search in which fields.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>from:mike</b> or <b>f:mike</b>
        </p>
        <p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'mike' in the <i>from</i>
          field.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>to:bill</b> or <b>t:bill</b>
        </p>
        <p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'bill' in the
          <i>to</i> or <i>cc</i> fields of the message.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>tonocc:bill</b> or <b>cc:tom</b> or <b>bcc:riddle</b>
        </p>
        <p>Like above, <b>tonocc</b> will search <i>to</i> field only, <b>cc/bcc</b> will search <i>cc/bcc</i> field
          only. Case insensitive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>only:tom</b> or <b>o:tom</b>
        </p>
        <p>Search for 'tom', and 'tom' should be the only recipients in <i>to</i> field. Case insensitive.<br />
          Note: 'only:(tom or jerry)' will get message that <i>to</i> field is 'tom' or 'jerry' only, while 'only:(tom
          and jerry)' will get nothing, please use 'only:(tom,jerry)' instead if you want to search emails that
          recipients contain and only contain both 'tom' and 'jerry'.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>fromto:tom</b> or <b>ft:tom</b>

          <b>subject:electric bill</b> or <b>s:electric bill</b>
        </p>
        <p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'electric bill'
          in the <i>subject</i> fields of the message. Case insensitive.

          This is the GMail search-equivalent of: <kbd>-foo -bar</kbd>.
        </p>
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Hot Key</h3>
    <p>
      By default, Press Ctrl+Shift+K, your cursor will appear in the expression search bar and
      you will be able to type.</p>
    <p>Once you are typing in your search query, and you hit enter or otherwise let
      it begin searching, your cursor will remain inside of the query box to allow you
      to modify the query. However, if you'd rather go back to browsing your messages,
      instead of clicking on the message headers in your search results, you can just
      press 'ESC' to to clear the search criteria, and press 'ESC' again to refocus back</p>

    <h3>Quick Search Virtual Folder</h3>
    <p>Virtual search folders are a standard and powerful feature of Thunderbird. These folders appear
      in the folders list and their content depend on the search criteria associated with the given
      virtual folder. Note two useful things:
    <ol>
      <li>The 'contents' of the virtual folder can actually be in any of your real folders,
        and so a virtual folder actually can 'contain' messages that span many folders.</li>
      <li>The virtual folder's contents are recomputed each time you view it. If
        you saved a virtual folder with 'sender' field containing 'Donald' and you receive a new
        message from someone named Donald, it will not only appear in your INBOX, but also in your
        virtual folder.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>This extension makes it extremely easy to create these virtual search folders. Pressing 'ctrl-enter'
      in the Expression search quick search bar is not only executing the search, but will create (or
      update) the virtual folder called 'ExpressionSearch' for the currently entered search expression.
      By default, this search will be executed in all folders of the current account.</p>
    <p>The resulting virtual folder 'ExpressionSearch' can then be modified by editing its properties,
      and can be renamed to make it a permanent virtual search folder. If you do not rename the folder,
      the next time you use ctrl-enter the ExpressionSearch virtual folder is reused to show your new
      quick search result.
    </p>
    <a name='keep_saved_search'></a>
    <p>The option "<b>Keep selected folders for saved search</b>" will limit the search to the folders
      currently defined in the settings of the "ExpressionSearch" virtual search folder (if it exists).
      Use this setting if you want to manually specify which of your physical folders should be searched
      with a global non-faceted search (CTRL+Enter).</p>
    <p>The location where the virtual search folder "ExpressionSearch" is created can be set in the option
      dialog. It defaults to the root folder of the current displayed folder</p>
    <p>You can jump back to original folder by pressing Ctrl+Alt+LEFT</p>

    <h3>More complex searching</h3>
    <p>The quick search bar allows you use the simple expressions from above, but it also
      allows you to compose more complex searches. For instance, if you want to search for
      a message from Bob Barker to Dave Letterman about monologues, you can use:

    </p>
    <p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues</b>
    </p>
    <p>If you are tired of getting results that have jokes about "Monica", you can instead use:

    </p>
    <p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues -Monica</b>
    </p>
    <p>If you are interested in messages from either of these celebrities:

    </p>
    <p><b>f:Bob Barker or f:Dave Letterman</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Note 1: For the average user, the above information is usually adequate. If you
      are curious, this feature still relies upon an underlying Thunderbird message searching
      mechanism. That mechanism cannot always perform searches correctly that have a combination of boolean
      operators. So, if you try to perform a search that mixes "ands" and "ors" you may get back
      too many results. As an example, if you were to search for "t:dan and f:(bob or dave)" you
      will be mixing boolean operators and the results may be over inclusive or may work. As an extra technical
      note, if you did "t:dan and -f:(bob or dave)", DeMorgan's theorem takes place and you are actually
      composing a search of "t:dan and f:-bob and f:-dave".
    </p>
    <p>
      However, due to restrictions in Thunderbird's virtual search folder, the complex searching results maybe correct
      in your current search results, but maybe NOT in you search folder. as the search folder can only handle 'Match
      all'
      and 'Match any' types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note 2: If you want search all folders using expression, you can create a virtual folder manually (Ctrl+Shift+F)
      with 'Match all messages',
      then using expression search in the virtual folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note 3: In case you also using the normal search filter, the final results is logically "AND", that means
      both filter are effective.
    </p>

    <h3>Click 2 Search</h3>
    <p>
      If Enabled, you can use Ctrl/Shift+Right Click on sender/recipient/subject column to search for the same sender,
      recipient or subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="c2s_Replace"></a>
      For subject line, if provided regular expression match/replace patterns and enabled the replace for corresponding
      key combo, the pattern will be first executed
    <pre>Replace subject before search.
Multiple matches are ORed. Example:
    Match:   \[#(\d*)\]
    Replace: $1
    Subject: [#1212][#2323]Some text
    Result:  (1212 or 2323)</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also common prefix like 'Re:', 'Fw:', [mail-list-name] will be removed before search.
