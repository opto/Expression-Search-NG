    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Update to SuperNova - TB 115: Asking for
      Donations</h1>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>There are very substantial code changes in TB 115. The main window has
      been converted from XUL to HTML, many elements are gone or have a
      different id, the 'QuickFilterBarMuxer' and the quickfilter-expando have
      been replaced, mail:3pane is now about:3pane, and .....&nbsp; many more
      changes.</p>
    <p>I have tested that the conversion for TB 115 is doable and that filters
      will run as before - already for the fundamental functionality, such as</p>
    <p>s:subject f:fromsomewher t:tosomeone</p>
    <p>That works in 115.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Now it needs a lot of work to bring everything into the new layout with
      General toolbar, etc.</p>
    <h3><span><b>Donations are very much welcome.</b></span></h3>
